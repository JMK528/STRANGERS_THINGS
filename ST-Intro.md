## Project Status

### What We Have Done

- Built the foundation of the React Application from scratch
- Created some components:
  - Navbar
  - Posts
  - Profile
  - Home
- Setup some routes in the App component and links in the nav bar to navigate between components.
- Setup an api file to fetch all posts and now displaying posts details.

### What Needs To Be Done

- Complete Home component
- Update Nav Bar based on if user is logged in or not
- Update Posts component based on if user is logged in or not
- Create Single Post component
- Create Message Form component so User can send message
- Give capability for user to log in and log out
- Add Post
- Add Search to Post View
- Profile Component
  - User logs in and can see Messages they sent and Messgaes sent to them (look at API docs for this)
- On Single Post View, a user should see "Send Message" if they did not create the post.
  - If they created the post they should see "View" which allows them to Edit or Delete post (Use API)
  - And they can see Messages on this post
- STYLING !
