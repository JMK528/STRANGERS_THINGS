## Project Status

### What We Have Done:

- A new user can be registered.
- A token is being stored in state and local-storage
- The register component redirects user to the Profile route.
- The user can log out.
  
### What Needs To Be Done

- Complete Home component
- Update Nav Bar based on if user is logged in or not
- Update Posts component based on if user is logged in or not
- Create Single Post component
- Create Message Form component so User can send message
- Give capability for user to log in
- Add Post
- Add Search to Post View
- Profile Component
  - User logs in and can see Messages they sent and Messgaes sent to them (look at API docs for this)
- On Single Post View, a user should see "Send Message" if they did not create the post.
  - If they created the post they should see "View" which allows them to Edit or Delete post (Use API)
  - And they can see Messages on this post
- STYLING !
